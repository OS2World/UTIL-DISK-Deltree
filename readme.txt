A clone of the MSDOS/Win95/Win98 Deltree command for OS/2.

As with all utilities of this kind please test it thorougly before
trusting it with your files. I have tested it and it is being used daily
but your mileage may vary.

Usage:
deltree [options] directory...

Options:
	-y	don't ask
	-v	verbose
	-q	quiet
	-p	print only - no execute
